    would become. One of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up more than 7 million views per

    <li>½ cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
    <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
         <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients</strong>: Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Cook the Meat</strong>: In a Dutch oven over medium heat, cook the sausage, ground beef, onion, and
                garlic until well browned.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Make the Sauce</strong>: Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with
                sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Cover and
                simmer for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Cook the Noodles</strong>: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles for 8 to 10
                minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Mixture</strong>: In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, the remaining 2
                tablespoons of parsley, and ½ teaspoon salt.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Preheat the Oven</strong>: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        
            <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                    <li>Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over the sauce, slightly overlapping.</li>
                    <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.</li>
                    <li>Top with ⅓ of the mozzarella cheese slices.</li>
                    <li>Spoon 1 ½ cups of meat sauce over the mozzarella and sprinkle with ¼ cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        
            <li><strong>Layer and Top</strong>: Repeat the layers, finishing with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
                Cover the dish with foil. To prevent sticking, either spray the foil with cooking spray or ensure it doesn't
                touch the cheese.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Bake</strong>: Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25
                minutes until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Rest and Serve</strong>: Allow the lasagna to rest for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    
    </ol>
