    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>Everyone needs to know how to make a classic grilled cheese sandwich. Whether you're a beginner cook or an old pro,
    you'll come back to this top-rated grilled cheese recipe again and again.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 slices white bread</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Bread for Grilled Cheese:</h2>

    <p>This recipe calls for plain white sandwich bread. You could also use sourdough, brioche, or even ciabatta. You can
    really make grilled cheese with any type of bread you like, but you should make sure the loaf is sturdy enough to handle
    the heat. Thinly sliced, delicate breads will quickly fall apart.</p>

        <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Generously butter one side of a slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese.</li>
        <li>Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place it butter-side up on top of the cheese.</li>
        <li>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until the cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slices of cheese.</li>
    </ol>
